# Data-Science
I will be exploring different ML algorithms...
Machine Learning - Load and Explore Dataset
'Boston House Prices' Dataset is being considered for this purpose to start with.
Jupyter Notebook with Sklearn built in dataset is considered for this example
And, I will walk you through Linear Regression using the above dataset in the "BostonLinearRegression-Venkat.ipynb" example code.
Now, I am going to consider Iris dataset for exploring the Logistic Regression and KNN Classifier
For the above Logistic Regression and KNN Classifier, the example code can be found in "ML Logistic Regression-KNN-Venkat.ipynb"
Next, I am going to explore K-means Clustering
For this, I am planning to experiment with built in random sample generators with make_blobs
For the above KMeans Clustering , the example code can be found in "ML-K-Means Clustering-Venkat.ipynb"
Let's look at the PCA(Principle Components Analysis) for exploring Dimensionality Reduction
For the above PCA , the example code can be found in "ML-PCA-Venkat.ipynb"
