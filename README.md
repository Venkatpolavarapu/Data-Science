# Data-Science
I will be exploring different ML algorithms.
Machine Learning - Load and Explore Data set
'Boston House Prices' Data set is being considered for this purpose
Jupyter Notebook with Sklearn built in data set is considered for this example
And, I will walk you through Linear Regression using the above dataset in the "BostonLinearRegression-Venkat" example code.
Now, I am going to consider Iris dataset for exploring the Logistic Regression using KNN
