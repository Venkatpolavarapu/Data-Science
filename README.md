# Data-Science
I will be exploring different ML algorithms...
Machine Learning - Load and Explore Data set
'Boston House Prices' Data set is being considered for this purpose to start with.
Jupyter Notebook with Sklearn built in data set is considered for this example
And, I will walk you through Linear Regression using the above dataset in the "BostonLinearRegression-Venkat.ipynb" example code.
Now, I am going to consider Iris dataset for exploring the Logistic Regression and KNN Classifier
For the above Logistic Regression and KNN Classifier, the example code can be found in "ML Logistic Regression-KNN-Venkat.ipynb"
